# Children's Book Age Recommender

A simple web application that recommends reading age for children's books based on the book's title.

The application is built using
- [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml): an easy-to-use framework to build webapps using python
- [CrossHatch](https://crosshatch.app/): an API that lets you pick the "best" model without any manual intervention
